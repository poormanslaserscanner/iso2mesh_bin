# iso2mesh_bin
[iso2mesh](http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net) is a 3D surface and volumetric mesh generator for MATLAB/Octave. 
Some of its functions are used in pmls4matlab. It is based on a collection of binary tools written in C/C++. 
Compiled binaries can be downloaded for several platforms from the project's website. 
Unfortunately for 64 bit windows the binaries are not available, so I had to compiled them.
